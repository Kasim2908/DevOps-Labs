# 📖 What is a Dockerfile?

A **Dockerfile** is a text file containing instructions to automatically build a Docker image.

Instead of manually installing software every time, Docker executes each instruction step-by-step to create a reusable image.

---

# 🧱 Common Dockerfile Instructions

## FROM

Specifies the base image.

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:24.04
```

Every Dockerfile starts with a `FROM` instruction.

---

## RUN

Executes commands while building the image.

```dockerfile
RUN apt update && apt install -y curl
```

Each `RUN` creates a new image layer.

---

## WORKDIR

Sets the working directory inside the container.

```dockerfile
WORKDIR /app
```

Equivalent to:

```bash
cd /app
```

---

## COPY

Copies files from the host to the image.

```dockerfile
COPY . .
```

Example:

```
Host
 ├── app.js
 └── package.json

↓

Container (/app)
 ├── app.js
 └── package.json
```

---

## ADD

Copies files like `COPY` but can also:

- Extract local tar files
- Download remote URLs

Example:

```dockerfile
ADD project.tar.gz /app
```

> **Best Practice:** Prefer `COPY` unless you specifically need `ADD` features.

---

## ENV

Defines environment variables.

```dockerfile
ENV APP_ENV=production
```

Access inside container:

```bash
echo $APP_ENV
```

---

## EXPOSE

Documents the port used by the application.

```dockerfile
EXPOSE 8080
```

It does **not** publish the port automatically.

---

## CMD

Specifies the default command executed when the container starts.

```dockerfile
CMD ["bash"]
```

---

## ENTRYPOINT

Defines the main executable for the container.

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]
```

---

# CMD vs ENTRYPOINT

Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT ["echo"]
CMD ["Hello Docker"]
```

Run:

```bash
docker run demo
```

Output:

```
Hello Docker
```

Run:

```bash
docker run demo DevOps
```

Output:

```
DevOps
```

`CMD` provides default arguments, while `ENTRYPOINT` defines the executable.

---

# Shell Form vs Exec Form

## Shell Form

```dockerfile
CMD echo "Hello Docker"
```

Runs using:

```
/bin/sh -c
```

---

## Exec Form

```dockerfile
CMD ["echo", "Hello Docker"]
```

Recommended because:

- Better signal handling
- No shell process
- Predictable behavior

---

# Docker Layer Caching

Every Dockerfile instruction creates a layer.

```
FROM Ubuntu
      │
RUN apt install curl
      │
COPY .
      │
ENV APP_ENV
      │
CMD
```

If only the last instruction changes, Docker reuses all previous cached layers, making builds much faster.

---

# Cache Invalidation

Changing one instruction invalidates that layer and all layers below it.

Example:

```
FROM
RUN
COPY   ← changed
ENV
CMD
```

Docker rebuilds:

- COPY
- ENV
- CMD

Previous layers remain cached.

---

# Build Context

When running:

```bash
docker build .
```

The `.` represents the **build context**.

Docker sends all files in the current directory to the Docker daemon.

```
Project Folder
│
├── Dockerfile
├── app.js
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

Everything inside the folder is available for `COPY` or `ADD`.

# ✅ Best Practices

- Use lightweight base images (e.g., Alpine) when appropriate.
- Keep images small.
- Use `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files.
- Prefer `COPY` over `ADD` unless extra functionality is required.
- Combine related `RUN` commands to reduce image layers.
- Use the Exec Form for `CMD` and `ENTRYPOINT`.

---

# 🎯 Key Takeaways

- Dockerfiles automate image creation.
- Every instruction creates a new layer.
- Docker uses layer caching to speed up builds.
- `CMD` defines the default command.
- `ENTRYPOINT` defines the executable.
- `COPY` transfers files from the host to the image.
- `WORKDIR` sets the working directory.
- `ENV` defines environment variables.
- `EXPOSE` documents the application port.

# 💡 Interview Questions

### 1. What is a Dockerfile?

A Dockerfile is a text file containing instructions to build a Docker image automatically.

---

### 2. What is the difference between COPY and ADD?

- **COPY:** Copies files from the host into the image.
- **ADD:** Can also extract local archives and download remote URLs.

---

### 3. What is Docker layer caching?

Docker caches image layers to avoid rebuilding unchanged instructions, improving build performance.

---

### 4. What is Build Context?

The build context is the directory sent to the Docker daemon during `docker build`, containing files available to the Dockerfile.

---

### 5. Difference between CMD and ENTRYPOINT?

- **CMD:** Specifies the default command or arguments and can be overridden.
- **ENTRYPOINT:** Defines the main executable and is intended to remain fixed.

---

### 6. Why is Exec Form preferred?

It avoids running through a shell, provides better signal handling, and is more predictable for containerized applications.
